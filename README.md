Built in C++, the Book Recommender System showcases object-oriented principles, advanced algorithms, and optimized data structures to deliver tailored book recommendations. Drawing data from files, the system parses and manages a list of users, books, and their respective ratings. Emphasizing efficiency and data integrity, unique book entries are maintained using sets, while maps expedite rapid data lookups. Use of vectors of object pointer insure a many to many (book and user) relationship can be maintain in a no duplicative manner. A dot-plot inspired algorithm identifies users with congruent reading tastes, serving suggestions of unread books that align with their preferences. Exception handling ensures robustness, gracefully addressing potential discrepancies like invalid ratings.
